# Kespry SDK
This project contains the pre-built client SDKs for Kespry APIs and a sample application. Currently only JavaScript client SDKs and sample are provided.

Clone the repository locally. 
```
git clone https://github.com/kespry/kespry_sdk.git
```

Run the sample application by changing your working directory into the `javascript/sample` folder and execute the following commands.
```
cd kespry_sdk/javascript/sample
npm install
KESPRY_API_HOST=https://staging-services.kespry.com npm start
```

A valid set of API credentials (key and secret) are required for the application.
